# MeetFurry
Final Year Project 

Pet overpopulation is a serious issue in not only Malaysia but all around the world. Even though animal shelters rescue many animals every year, there are even
more pets being abandoned by their owner. Adoption should be practiced in order to reduce pet overpopulation. The possible solution to solve this problem is
to provide a platform to let the available adoption information reach out to many possible pet parents. We are aiming to design a mobile application that mainly
focuses on pet adoption. The solution has a good impact on particularly these three groups of people, which is the people that are looking for adopting pets,
animal lovers, and animal welfare shelters. Evolutionary prototype model has been selected for this project development. Focus group discussion and
documentation study is performed in this project to gather requirements. Furthermore, Graphical notation will be used to portray the system function. The
MeetFurry mobile application is developed in Android platform and is coded with Java. The software that we have used to develop this mobile application are
Android Studio and Google Firebase. In the final testing, we run through a complete whole system to demonstrate to the supervisor and moderator to get the
feedback. The strength of this project is all the functionality proposed, but there are still some flaws and improvements can be made in the future.
